## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant mid-tone blue (#4A90E2), capturing the sporty nature of soccer while avoiding overly saturated tones.
- Background color: A light blue with low saturation (#E0F2F7), providing a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: A slightly darker, analogous blue (#213365), for interactive elements to stand out.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a versatile sans-serif for clear and readable text. Headline font: 'Playfair', a stylish serif, works well for headlines with 'PT Sans' for the body.
- Use soccer-themed icons. Consider icons to illustrate each section of the app and improve clarity.
- Subtle animations and transitions during team generation and display. Focus on smooth fade-in effects and color changes on interactive elements to acknowledge user actions and maintain a clean user experience.
